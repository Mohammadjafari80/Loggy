	- I am actively involved in a research project that is
	  developing an automated system
	- his project has opened my eyes to a broad range of research in computer graphics and
	  motivated me to undertake further study through a Ph.D. program
	- I am open to trying new ideas as well.
	- These experiences attracted me to various research problems in applications for ...
	- For these reasons, the EECS department of MIT is especially attractive to me
	- I am intrigued by several interesting research projects carried on by its faculty members
	- In particular, Professor Wojciech Matusik’s and ....
	- I especially enjoyed reading the paper about ...
	- it would be a privilege to study in the EECS department of MIT under the guidance of its remarkable faculty.
	- I have enjoyed being able to apply what I learned in classes such as computer graphics and
	  computational geometry to my research
	- I seek different kinds of creativity in engineering and art; both come from the persevering effort driven by the will to create something new and better. It is this creative will that I wish to pursue in MIT's Ph.D.
	- Through my graduate studies, I expect to become, and will work hard to be, an effective researcher and teacher.

	- My long and enjoyable interaction with computer science goes back one and a half decades, to the moment when I first learned to program
	- Given my background, I believe I am in a good position to make crucial contributions in such pursuits.
- ## EPFL
	- expand my horizons, it’s an intensely international institution
	- engage in research at a global level, it was through research that I was able to immerse myself in real and meaningful challenges.
	- ill challenge you intellectually, introduce you to countless new cultures and cuisines, and facilitate enormous personal growth. It may very well be the best summer you ever have!
	- I loved this opportunity to talk to experts in their fields – to broaden my horizon and sometimes to advance my research.
